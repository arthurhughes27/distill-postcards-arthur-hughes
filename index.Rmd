## Bio

I am a PhD student in biostatistics at the University of Bordeaux, France. I work on new methodology for analysing high-dimensional molecular data in the context of vaccine experiments. My research interests include causal inference, surrogate markers, and non-parametric approaches with high-dimensional, low sample size applications in immunology.
